<p>Hi goodmorning, I’m kind of tired of the real <em>paper</em> journal.
So I spent some time creating this “journal” alias and then fixing some
issues with nvim. Turns out there were no real issues, I just figured
out today finally how to automatically attach an LSP server to a file
type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP] You just add the server name in the lspconfig. It was that
fucking simple I’m gonna kill myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="pm">12:28 PM</h3>
<p>It’s <strong>12:28</strong> right now and I still haven’t gotten any
real work done for footloose. I need to catch up to the WhatsApp
chats.</p>
<p>Atharv still isn’t here, I guess he’s working from home. They have a
call with the agency going on right now. But I don’t need to join it.
Huh. I guess I don’t have any real work to do right now.</p>
<h3 id="pm-call-with-ishan">1:45 PM Call with Ishan:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shots of dust on the table, line created by the dust</li>
<li>Going a little back to show sincere cleaning as well, references for
that</li>
<li>References of Mopping and Chopping with band</li>
<li>Really ugly ass table or kitchen sink</li>
<li>Chalani Reference</li>
</ul>
<p>I am possibly getting a little bored / tired of this. I would prefer
to be outside. ugh. I guess I can just do namak work nvm.</p>
<p>Atharv just left at 5:30, he’s gonna attend that call from home. I’m
also like done so I’m leaving in 5 minutes as well. It’s 5:45 rn.</p>

<p>Goodmorning dear. Sunday was very nice, I didn’t do any work because
jeez it’s sunday. There was a recce that I couldn’t attend because I had
to shift, also because I didn’t have enough sleep. I thought I could go
and attend it but the moment my head hit the bed I was sleeping before I
even knew it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around this time Kedhhar also told Ishan he wanted to talk to
Indrashish and make some changes, lowk felt like he was scolding the
team or sm. Saying the storyboard and rest was too ambitious</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyways, at the office I walked in to see a blue bag on the outside
table and wires on the inside table. Looks like the electricity was
gone. I wanted to shoot because when else would I get the opportunity to
do that, I met a cat and I pet the cat mau.</p>
<p>Ishan had called me before I left for an edit I needed to put
together in premiere (or it could be any NLE). But when I asked him for
the footage he said he was going to do it himself, sure why not.</p>
<p>I’m back to looking for very specific, lowkey useless references for
the dumb ass client. One was for one singer sliding on the floor and
another was for the Uncle giving shabaashi to the husband.</p>

<p>Indrashish is explaining the UC Storyboard. End of the storyboard
part, he sent them the 60s storyboard link. <a
href="https://youtu.be/5B4n4RN-ERU">UC Animatics 60</a></p>
<p><strong>UC replying:</strong> The TG feels too young. Where two young
individuals are too lazy to open up, but the target audience is supposed
to be more audience. They should not just be lazy but rather they don’t
have enough time to clean up. Get the positioning from the TG POV not be
that young, overall they’re unorganized individual. But rather it should
be two individuals in a stressfull situation.</p>
<p><strong>IM Reply</strong>: I think it takes care of the fact that
this is not that TG that you’re talking about. Lets not monopolize
parties to only younger people. A lot of people on the call included the
hall doesn’t look pretty after a party. But the art of the house and the
furniture immediately makes it evident that they’re older than 25.</p>
<p>The fact that they’re very hard press of time won’t be able to be
expressed in this context.</p>
<p>You needed the party to happen to exaggerate that there was that much
mess. We don’t actually need to see the party. But having the party
there eleveates the mess. The visuals should not seem tame compared to
the wild song.</p>
<p><strong>UC:</strong> Maybe instead of them lying on the bed they’re
just lounging in the house. Overall it could look like an adult
party.</p>
<p><strong>IM</strong> What can we do to make it look unskippable from
the start? Which is why the scene of them lying on the couch. They’re
just vegitating and watching TV.</p>
<p><strong>UC</strong> The house needs to be justifiably messy.. (sure
buddy), rather than decadent. What could happen to everyday people
rather than a lazy couple after a party.</p>
