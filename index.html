<h3>31.01.26</h3>
<p>Hi goodmorning, I’m kind of tired of the real <em>paper</em> journal.
So I spent some time creating this “journal” alias and then fixing some
issues with nvim. Turns out there were no real issues, I just figured
out today finally how to automatically attach an LSP server to a file
type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!TIP] You just add the server name in the lspconfig. It was that
fucking simple I’m gonna kill myself.</p>
</blockquote>

<section id="pm" class="level3">
<h3>12:28 PM</h3>
<p>It’s <strong>12:28</strong> right now and I still haven’t gotten any
real work done for footloose. I need to catch up to the WhatsApp
chats.</p>
<p>Atharv still isn’t here, I guess he’s working from home. They have a
call with the agency going on right now. But I don’t need to join it.
Huh. I guess I don’t have any real work to do right now.</p>
</section>
<section id="pm-call-with-ishan" class="level3">
<h3>1:45 PM Call with Ishan:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Shots of dust on the table, line created by the dust</li>
<li>Going a little back to show sincere cleaning as well, references for
that</li>
<li>References of Mopping and Chopping with band</li>
<li>Really ugly ass table or kitchen sink</li>
<li>Chalani Reference</li>
</ul>
<p>I am possibly getting a little bored / tired of this. I would prefer
to be outside. ugh. I guess I can just do namak work nvm.</p>
<p>Atharv just left at 5:30, he’s gonna attend that call from home. I’m
also like done so I’m leaving in 5 minutes as well. It’s 5:45 rn.</p>

<h3>11:37 AM</h3>
<p>Goodmorning dear. Sunday was very nice, I didn’t do any work because
jeez it’s sunday. There was a recce that I couldn’t attend because I had
to shift, also because I didn’t have enough sleep. I thought I could go
and attend it but the moment my head hit the bed I was sleeping before I
even knew it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Around this time Kedhhar also told Ishan he wanted to talk to
Indrashish and make some changes, lowk felt like he was scolding the
team or sm. Saying the storyboard and rest was too ambitious</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyways, at the office I walked in to see a blue bag on the outside
table and wires on the inside table. Looks like the electricity was
gone. I wanted to shoot because when else would I get the opportunity to
do that, I met a cat and I pet the cat mau.</p>
<p>Ishan had called me before I left for an edit I needed to put
together in premiere (or it could be any NLE). But when I asked him for
the footage he said he was going to do it himself, sure why not.</p>
<p>I’m back to looking for very specific, lowkey useless references for
the dumb ass client. One was for one singer sliding on the floor and
another was for the Uncle giving shabaashi to the husband.</p>

<p>Indrashish is explaining the UC Storyboard. End of the storyboard
part, he sent them the 60s storyboard link. <a
href="https://youtu.be/5B4n4RN-ERU">UC Animatics 60</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC replying:</strong> The TG feels too young. Where two young
individuals are too lazy to open up, but the target audience is supposed
to be more audience. They should not just be lazy but rather they don’t
have enough time to clean up. Get the positioning from the TG POV not be
that young, overall they’re unorganized individual. But rather it should
be two individuals in a stressfull situation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IM Reply</strong>: I think it takes care of the fact that
this is not that TG that you’re talking about. Lets not monopolize
parties to only younger people. A lot of people on the call included the
hall doesn’t look pretty after a party. But the art of the house and the
furniture immediately makes it evident that they’re older than 25.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The fact that they’re very hard press of time won’t be able to be
expressed in this context.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You needed the party to happen to exaggerate that there was that much
mess. We don’t actually need to see the party. But having the party
there eleveates the mess. The visuals should not seem tame compared to
the wild song.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC:</strong> Maybe instead of them lying on the bed they’re
just lounging in the house. Overall it could look like an adult
party.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>IM</strong> What can we do to make it look unskippable from
the start? Which is why the scene of them lying on the couch. They’re
just vegitating and watching TV.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UC</strong> The house needs to be justifiably messy.. (sure
buddy), rather than decadent. What could happen to everyday people
rather than a lazy couple after a party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After this they took like a 5 minute tea break. Came back talked a
little and then settled on everything.</p>
<p>While they did that I tried to figure out how to convert markdown to
html and <code>pandoc</code> came to the rescue, a pretty cool software
imo.</p>

<h1>9th Feb 2026, Monday</h1>
<p>Fuckkkk I haven’t journaled in like 4 days I don’t even know. I guess
since the last shoot. Not a lot happened though, the day after the shoot
I bunked (lmao) and I watched arcane 😭😭😭 oh my god it’s so fucking
sad and depressing I love Arcane 💙💜 so much!!!</p>
<p>On saturday not a lot happened, Mouse was very h*rny so I left early
but lowk everyone only left early like literally everyone.</p>
<p>On Sunday me and mouse went out and had a lot of fun! we went to kala
ghoda art festival, I had pav bhaji. Mousami Barfi &amp; Pav Joshi
hehehe.</p>
<p>Today, Monday fuck.</p>
<section id="pm-7" class="level2">
<h2>08:40 PM</h2>
<p>Yes I’m still at the office, I don’t know why. Today monday, just
worked on subtitling and actually worked a lot in resolve, fixed the hue
contrast thing, I think it looks much better now, also definitely breaks
much lesser oh my god 😭😭😭. Then made the footloose films circle logo,
wow such a huge job</p>
<p>yeah I’m going fucking home, the lunch was ass but I’m just going to
give it to mouse I only had the parathas all day I’m kind of starving
heh. Okay bye I’m leaving da office thank you.</p>
<p>Yeah and then my dumbass still didn’t leave the office and I stayed
for another fucking our. I actually met Snehal 🤍 on the way, we talked
for a fucking hour oh my god lmao. It was a lot of fun, but because of
that I couldn’t go to meet Mouse 💔. It’s okay. The dinner was, well, it
was good but I hadn’t had the lunch so I kind of felt bad. Also why the
fuck does she make so much sabzi and 2 rotis bro 😭😭😭.</p>
<p>I watched Rick &amp; Morty and slept 💤</p>

<h1>10th Feb 2026, Tuesday</h1>
<p>Yeah so, I woke up late LMAO. I mean I knew that I was going to be
late because my alarm ringed at <em>9:45 AM</em> but I just kept
snoozing it. Also there’s pigeons 🕊 above the damn AC.</p>
<p><strong>Atharva</strong> informed that he wasn’t going to come to the
office because he got fever. I messaged him <em>Take care Man &lt;
3</em> but he hasn’t replied to my message yet.</p>
<p>I walked in Surendra was cleaning all the awards and I was not late
but guess who was 🙄(Mudita was fucking late, and she was the one who
shouted at me for coming late yesterday for no fucking reason like?!?!).
I was playing with office cat hehe, I love the office cat it’s so sweet
:( .</p>
<p>Yeah the entire day I mostly just worked on the UC Shoot
Documentation film, like recreating the colors from Genesis, with some
very interesting and fun results if I say so myself. Yeah that’s
literally all that I did.</p>
<p>Lunch was okay, dinner was ass. It was chicken kheema and it smelled
really bad, I don’t know why. I just didn’t like it that much. I’m going
to go out now dawg fuck this shit. I’m going to go meet Mouse bye bye I
wasted too much time on fixing this treesitter bullshit ugh. It didn’t
even make a god damn difference to anything.</p>
<section id="am-1" class="level2">
<h2>02:28 AM</h2>
<p>Does anything matter…<br />
<em>I am living, I am alive, I am alive, why why why why</em>   I want
to make a gift for Mouse, I’m still confused if I should make a website
or if I should make a silly cute poster or sm. I should be sleeping
right but, I really don’t feel like sleeping. I feel like doing
something. I want to do something. <em>Something</em></p>

<p>I need to write down everything I need to do, that way I won’t forget
all that I need to do / want to do. Isn’t this the third fucking list
tho. Eh<br />
</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />Make valentine’s request for
Mouse</label></li>
<li><label><input type="checkbox" />I genuinely cannot think of anything
else, what the fuck.</label></li>
</ul>
<p>I guess the most important thing to remember, is to not forget that I
DO need to do a lot of things. If I have free time I cannot be picking
up new projects and shit. I have a lot of fucking work on my hand that I
need to do. Update my website and all yknow. Too many things to fit in
my fucking brain right now, this shit is so fragile, I literally can’t
remember shit man. I wish memories could be proof but you can’t trust
half of them jesus. This fucking sucks.</p>

<h2>01:56 PM</h2>
<p>I came in at around 1:30 PM, and yeah I got enough sleep I guess. I
mostly spent my morning doing nothing. I had to throw away that awful
old ass chana that was in my tiffin. It had the worst smell ever, I
couldn’t get it out of my head for a while.</p>
<p>The Rapido driver took way too long to show up, I knew that I was
going to be late. I thought about taking another rapido to the office
instead of walking. But I just felt like I, didn’t have to. I don’t get
paid enough for this. I don’t even do work when I’m at the office. It’s
been 20 minutes or so and I still haven’t really done anything yknow.
Doesn’t make sense that I would even have to anyways because there is
just no actual work for me. So I’m just going to work on Namak today I
guess.</p>
<p>Surendra came to ask if I wanted lunch so I’m just going to have
lunch now.</p>

<p>There is no work today AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA. I know I do have work that I
need to do. But yeah I just, I don’t even know what to do atp.</p>
<p>The Whole Truth Case study</p>

<h1>17th Feb 2026, Tuesday</h1>
<p>I actually didn’t write in the journal this day. But I did actually
get work (finally).</p>
<p>Atharva and me are working on the case study film for <strong>The
Whole Truth</strong>, so we both just started working on that. I
installed copyparty on the office iMac because why not, it makes it a
lot easier to access data on my laptop rather than using the shitty iMac
which is stable but it doesn’t have enough GPU power. I really think
they should’ve invested in a desktop PC instead, like most normal places
like why the fuck would you buy an intel iMac?! whatever.</p>
<p>I got copyparty up and running, then I started working on the motion
graphics for the case study film. I’m keeping it kinda simple and fun
with a collag-y and rough style like <em>Vox</em>. That’s definitely
going to be fun.</p>
<p>Atharva wrote the script so I just got till the part where we needed
it to be, then I went home.</p>
<p>Dnyanu wanted me to come with her to the doctor because she wasn’t
feeling well. So the both of us went to this Government hospital in
Adheri west, very close to Amar pav bhaji. It was a very huge hospital
and we genuinely got lost in the hospital. We were told to wait for half
an hour so I started reading “<strong>Bell Jar</strong>” In the waiting
room. I think I’m falling in love with the way Sylvia Plath writes. It’s
sultry, yearning and depressive nature really appeals to me.</p>
<p>We didn’t have any cash, so I had to ask people if they would
exchange cash with me so I could digitally reimburse them. When I asked
these two fellows outside the hospital, they started ruffling around in
their pockets. I glimpsed a 500 rupee note as it vanished back, right
when the orange man gave me 10 rupees of crumpled money. I asked them
for their UPI ID’s but they wouldn’t budge, I just had to let them be
kind to me.</p>

<h2>12:01 PM</h2>
<p>I think I feel tired. I felt tired as I climbed up a mountain of
stairs juggling my camera as the sun pierced my eyes. I caught 6 hours
of sleep in the night, reason for why I look ugly today. But it’s
because I didn’t shave, and I never shave often, so I often feel ugly. I
set up to record myself in the camera but I looked at myself and thought
<em>maybe I’ll do this tomorrow, after I look better and the cat is
here</em></p>
<p>Maybe I would do it tomorrow, idk how I feel about anything
really.</p>
<p>Atharva isn’t here today, he’s sick and I want to wish him well. I
don’t really have much work to do. I’m just going to reimagine my film
“Lost Life”, turn it into reality the way I concieved it.</p>
<p>I’m so phased that Mudita to write some short captions for the UC
Shoot Post. I’m pretty sure they already have a caption ready, but they
need it for thanking the Director.</p>
<p>Anyways, here are a few options I’m preparing: - Thank you so much,
<span class="citation" data-cites="mr.nicecat">@mr.nicecat</span> &amp;
<span class="citation"
data-cites="manjabrandworks">@manjabrandworks</span>, this shoot
wouldn’t exist without your creativity and strategy. This journey has
been an “Emotional rollercoaster” <code>this sucks</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>‘Emotional Atyachaar’ was bohot (very?) mazedaar! All thanks to

</ul>
<p>Mudita appreciated <strong>” ‘Ye directing writing kaun karega’ is

<p>It’s literally 11:00 PM right now, but I’m just writing this for the
rest of the day after lunch. I basically re-edited my LostLife film. I
should’ve transcoded it because now I can’t show it to Mouse which is
damn stupid of me to do. Yeah that’s basically it. I spent around an
hour setting up neovim and shit. Which is so fucking stupid man.</p>

<p>The entire day I basically just worked on my list of things that I
need to do. I uploaded <code>Lost Life</code> to YouTube</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSC5JQSpHKo">Lost
Life</a></p>
<p>Then I edited a bunch of photos from the old Goa &amp; Mumbai trips.
There were some really good photos there that I must release.</p>
<p>Found this interesting archive <a

<h2>09:33 PM</h2>
<p><strong>Literally hell rained down on me as I tried to figure out
what the fuck to do with this dilemma.</strong></p>
<p><em>Once upon a time</em> (around three years ago) I was in a sweaty,
suffocating tent supposed to be sleeping besides two other men. I recall
this like the haze it was. One of the men was named “<em>Hrit</em>”, a
tall big guy with a mouth bigger than he was. In the silver of the night
he was talking about music, and he asked me “Have you listened to Peter
Cat Recording Co. ?”. I felt intimidated, haphazardly answering
<em>no</em>. A minute before my life would change he told me to listen
to this track, titled “Clown on The 22nd Dance Floor”.</p>
<p>A few lush strings, playfully questioning me before a man started
speaking in the microphone. It was an eloquent jazz number with the
lyrics stretching me over it’s contexts.</p>
<p>“This if from an Indian Band”, I was shocked. <em>What?! they don’t
make music like this here</em>.</p>
<p>After an hour of blur around the fire I was drowsing. When I decided
to listen to the entire Album. <em>Portrait of a Time: 2010-2016</em>
released in 2018. That was a psychedelic experience if I’ve ever had
one.</p>
<p>A jazzy bar, a few lush strings and a piano tip toeing around
playfully.</p>
<p>“We have a shoot on 1st”, she smirked. I was back at the dilemma at
hand. “Wait, 1st March?” I asked, hoping my ears were broken. “Yes”.
This is where it started, a shoot on the 1st.</p>
<p>I met Rohan last year. Rohan Johnson was the photographer for Peter
Cat Recording Co. He shot their last, big tour and I actually talked to
him. TO HIM. I talked with him and I kept up and I finally asked him if
I could shoot with him and he said yes. YES. I could shoot for my
favorite artist! I would be meeting the band at the jazz bar and I would
tell them I love them and all I’ve done is listen and listen for what
felt like forever. The concert was on 1st March.</p>
<p>“I can’t come for the shoot”, I said. I couldn’t, I would never give
this up so I could assist for <em>cleartrip</em>, some tourism website.
They said no like they didn’t hear me. They denied me this day like I
didn’t exist. Like I wasn’t saying I couldn’t be there.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter to me, if I lost this job, or if I would have to
start my graduation project again. I wasn’t going to give up on shooting
for my favorite band.</p>
<p>I left the office. <em>some fucking drama with work finally</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Pallavi, I’m really sorry but I cannot be available on the 1st of
March. I’ve been trying to make this shoot (which is happening on the
first) happen for years now and 1st March would be my only chance.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would completely understand if my salary is cut due to this reason
(for another AD). If the Cleartrip shoot day is changed or the Concert
date is changed I’ll definitely be available, and even on any other
weekend a shoot happens. This is just a special exception, this won’t
happen again.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m very committed to footloose and I wouldn’t take a leave like this
for any other reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I would also like to know what is the minimum or expected time span
before which I need to inform about a leave. When I joined I was told
around a one week notice should be enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She replied after an eternity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Parth, I understand this is important for you, especially if you
have been trying to make it happen for a while. At the same time, if
something has been planned for months, we really need to be informed
about your availability much earlier. For any planned leave, minimum of
15 days notice is required. emergencies are, of course an exception.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, being there for prep but not on the main shoot won’t help you
understand the shoot process. The shoot day is the most crucial part,
especially for a project of this scale.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am not dismissing your reason, but we need to be more proactive
about communication going forward..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had thought of what I would do if I lost this job. It didn’t have
to come to that, but I was prepared.</p>
<p>I then had my dinner, in peace.</p>
